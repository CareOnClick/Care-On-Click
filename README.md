### Links
Text goes in brackets [] and the url goes into parens ( ). Note: Make sure the first paren is touching the last bracket.

### Styling
Use **asterisks** to bold text
Use _underline_ for italics

### Code Block
```ruby
puts "Hello World!"
```

### Embedding images
Notes: 
- Files should either exist in the current GH source directory or you can use a full url to point to an image on a server. 
- Use %20 for any spaces in the file name.

### Embed a video from Youtube
Similar to images but with an extra set of brackets and parens while you specify a thumbnail image. Click on logo to launch video. P.S. You will want to add a screen shot of your video in the place of the logo.
